## üß¨ Abstract
Acupuncture has been widely used as an effective treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation. However, the potential association between acupuncture sensation, an important factor influencing treatment efficacy, and brain functional network is unclear. This research sought to reveal and quantify the changes in brain functional network associated with acupuncture sensation. So multi-channel EEG signals were collected from 30 healthy participants and the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess their needling sensations. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was used to construct the brain functional network, which was analyzed with graph theoretic methods. It showed that in the needle insertion (NI) state the MASS Index was significantly higher than in the needle retention (NR) state (

## ‚ú® GPT Supported Summary (English)
Acupuncture, widely used as an effective treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation, has an unclear potential relationship with the brain functional network, a significant factor affecting treatment effectiveness. This research aimed to uncover and quantify the changes in the brain functional network linked to acupuncture sensation. Thus, multi-channel EEG signals were collected from 30 healthy participants, and the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was used to evaluate their needling sensations. The Phase Lag Index (PLI) was employed to build the brain functional network, which was analyzed with graph theoretic methods. The study revealed that the MASS Index was significantly higher in the needle insertion (NI) state compared to the needle retention (NR) state.

## üß† Scientific Commentary (English)
This research could be a pioneering study supporting the potential scientific validity of Traditional Chinese Medicine by revealing a neurological connection associated with acupuncture application. The effectiveness of acupuncture may have a direct effect on what is described as a pain sensation in an intervention, which could affect our brain. The strong aspect of the study is the use of modern tools such as EEG technology and graph theory. The weakness is that it only involves healthy participants and leaves uncertainty about the applicability of the findings into a more extensive patient population in a clinical setting. The potential importance of this study in clinical practice is to more deeply understand the potential therapeutic effects and neurological mechanisms of acupuncture.
