# The potential associations between acupuncture sensation and brain functional network: a EEG study.

**Authors:** Dongyang Shen, Banghua Yang, Jing Li, Jiayang Zhang, Yongcong Li, Guofu Zhang, Yanyan Zheng

## üß¨ Abstract
Acupuncture has been widely used as an effective treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation. However, the potential association between acupuncture sensation, an important factor influencing treatment efficacy, and brain functional network is unclear. This research sought to reveal and quantify the changes in brain functional network associated with acupuncture sensation. So multi-channel EEG signals were collected from 30 healthy participants and the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess their needling sensations. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was used to construct the brain functional network, which was analyzed with graph theoretic methods. It showed that in the needle insertion (NI) state the MASS Index was significantly higher than in the needle retention (NR) state (

## ‚ú® GPT Supported Summary (English)
The research aims to investigate the potential association between acupuncture sensation and brain functional network. This association is still unclear, although acupuncture has been widely recognized as an effective treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation. Multi-channel EEG signals were collected from 30 healthy participants and Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was used to evaluate their needling sensations to provide more insights into the matter and quantify the changes in the brain functional network associated with acupuncture sensation. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was employed to construct the brain functional network, which was later analyzed with graph theoretic methods. The study found that the MASS Index was significantly higher in the needle insertion (NI) state than the needle retention (NR) state.
