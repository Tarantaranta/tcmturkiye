Acupuncture has been widely used as an effective treatment for post-stroke rehabilitation. However, the potential association between acupuncture sensation, an important factor influencing treatment efficacy, and brain functional network is unclear. This research sought to reveal and quantify the changes in brain functional network associated with acupuncture sensation. So multi-channel EEG signals were collected from 30 healthy participants and the Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale (MASS) was utilized to assess their needling sensations. Phase Lag Index (PLI) was used to construct the brain functional network, which was analyzed with graph theoretic methods. It showed that in the needle insertion (NI) state the MASS Index was significantly higher than in the needle retention (NR) state (
